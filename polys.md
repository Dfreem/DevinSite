## Standard form

**The standard form** y = mx + b is a linear equation that represents a straight line on a graph.

- **y**
  represents the dependent variable, or the output. On a graph, it represents the vertical axis.

- **m**
    This is the slope of the line, which determines how much the value of y changes as the value of x changes. The slope can be positive or negative and can be steep or shallow.

- **x**
  This represents the independent variable, or the input. On a graph, it represents the horizontal axis.

- **b**
  This is the y-intercept, which is the value of y when x is equal to 0. It determines where the line crosses the y-axis.

## Find slope intercept

Given the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) of a linear equation y = mx + b, you can find the other.

To find the slope (m) given the y-intercept (b):

Choose two points on the line.
Determine the x and y values of each point.
Use the formula for the slope: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
To find the y-intercept (b) given the slope (m):

Choose a point on the line.
Determine the x and y values of the point.
Use the equation of the line: y = mx + b
Substitute the slope (m) and the x and y values of the point into the equation.
Solve for b.
Alternatively, you can also graph the line and determine the y-intercept from the graph by finding the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

## Quadratics

Graphing a quadratic equation involves finding the x and y values of the solutions, and then plotting those points on a coordinate plane.

To graph a quadratic equation:

Rewrite the equation in standard form: y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are coefficients.

Determine the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is located at (h, k), where h = -b / 2a and k = f(h). You can use this formula to find the x and y values of the vertex.

Determine two other points on the parabola. You can find these by substituting x values into the equation and solving for y.

Plot the three points on a coordinate plane.

Connect the three points with a smooth curve to form the graph of the parabola.

Note: If a is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and if a is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The width of the parabola is determined by the value of a, with a larger absolute value of a resulting in a narrower parabola.
